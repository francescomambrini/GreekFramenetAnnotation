# What is this?
In this repo, I share a few experiments on annotating Ancient Greek classica texts 
using the methods and guidelines of the [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/) project.

The annotation presupposes and integrates the morphosyntactic annotation of the [Ancient Greek and Latin Deependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/).

The textual annotation is performed with the web-based tool [Inception](https://inception-project.github.io/). 
At this moment, as the project is still very experimental, I share only an initial dump of a local copy of our 
Inception project. The dump should include some text (with minimal initial annotation, given as example), and the 
project configurations, including the tagset.

In a later stage, the project will be run on a dedicated server.

# Where are the guidelines for FrameNet annotation?
The initial draft of the guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/francescomambrini/GreekFramenetAnnotation/blob/master/Guidelines.md).

# How to run texts and annotation
Dowload and install Inception, either locally or an server (instructions [here](https://inception-project.github.io//releases/0.4.2/docs/user-guide.html#sect_installation)). 
Load the project in the `data` folder from within the Inception administration window (instructions [here](https://inception-project.github.io//releases/0.4.2/docs/user-guide.html#_import)).

Have fun!
