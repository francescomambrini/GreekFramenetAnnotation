# Guidelines for Framenet annotation of Ancient Greek (v.0.1)

**Attention**: this document is intended as a preliminary draft. Its aim is to 
sketch an initial workflow and a series of guidelines to create a FrameNet of 
Ancient Greek based on a full corpus annotation of some selected texts of the same 
type that the original Framenet project does with English.

## Framenet

### Frame semantics

[FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/) is a lexical database of English based on a theory of meaning called "Frame Semantics", which was proposed by Charles Fillmore in a series of publications. According to Frame Semantics, the meaning of a word "can best be understood on the basis of a semantic frame, a description of a type of event, relation, or entity and the participants in it" (quoted from [here](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/WhatIsFrameNet)). Instead of being simply a theory, 

The goal of this project is to extend this model to Ancient Greek for the first time, by concentrating on a full-text annotation of a number of classical texts. Our annotation builds upon the morphosyntactical annotation of the [Ancient Greek and Latin Deependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/).
